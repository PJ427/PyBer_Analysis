# PyBer_Analysis

V. Isualize has requested a brand-new analysis. Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


## Results:

As shown in the figure above the ride-sharing data includes: total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare by ride and average fare per driver by city type.  While Urban types generate more rides and fares the data shows that the cost is higher as we move away from urban areas.  This is attributed to the the decrease in population and the distance one has to travel out.

##Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
